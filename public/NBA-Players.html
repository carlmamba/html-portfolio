<h2>My Top 3 NBA players of all-time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Kobe Bryant</h3>

<p>Greatest of All Time! My inspiration since I was a child.</p>


<h3>Lebron James</h3>

<p>Lebron is one of the GOAT! Different player compare to Kobe and MJ, he's more a teamplayer.</p>

<h3>Michael Jordan</h3>

<p>Classic MJ! Considered as GOAT for most of the fans of NBA, but for me KOBE still the best!</p>
